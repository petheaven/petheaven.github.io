    - p: Klondike is our first breeding Peterbald. He is an absolutely sweetheart and has the loveliest temperament you can imagine - not your everyday stud! :-) He has fathered two litters in 2012, and all kittens has inherited his fantastic temper! Klondike has become a grandfather in 2013 :-)
    - p: He has now ended his stud career and has become a happy neuter, who will stay with us - we simply can't live without him! <3. We are so happy to have him and will be forever grateful to Indre Poceviciute, for letting us take this amazing boy to Denmark!
