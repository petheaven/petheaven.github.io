<h3>When you buy a kitten</h3>
<p>Our kittens are primarily sold as pets, therefore they will be neutered when they leave us. If you are looking for a kitten for breeding, please contact us before the kitten is 10 weeks old!</p>
<p>All kittens leaving home have their Felis Danica pedigree, first two vaccinations, ID chip and will be debugged and neutered!</p>
<p>Kittens are only sold as indoor cats or to homes with a cat pen or cat-fenced garden.</p>
